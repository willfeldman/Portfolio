        <p>
          Northeastern has a well-established co-op program. Students often
          complete two to three co-ops prior to graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my first co-op, I worked at Blueport Commerce as a Product Manager
          for 6 months. Blueport is an e-commerce platform for large furniture
          retailers. The challenges of high priced online sales are unique and
          require an omni-channel approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the co-op ended, Blueport offered me the opportunity to extend my
          time at the company under the position of Associate Product Manager. I
          continued working through the summer under this new role.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned a lot during my time at Blueport. This was my first time
          working a full-time job long-term, and it was also my first time
          working in Product Management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned tools such as Jira and Confluence for sprint management, and
          I was exposed to how tech companies organize and prioritize work.
