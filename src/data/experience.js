      <p>
        During my summer internship at StataPile, an AI firm that focuses on
        analyzing call center recordings for quality assurance and process
        optimizations, I embarked on an enriching journey in the rapidly growing
        field of artificial intelligence. As a high school intern, this experience
        provided valuable early exposure to the AI industry. My primary
        responsibility involved creating sophisticated spreadsheets weekly, allowing
        for a detailed analysis of the AI model's accuracy in interpreting consumer
        data. This task not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my
        understanding of how AI works and its applications in real-world scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my model analysis duties, I took the initiative to revamp the
        company's website backend. This redesign significantly enhanced the user
        experience for employees, streamlining their interaction with our systems
        and improving overall efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role also extended to conducting in-depth research on
        business-to-business (B2B) growth strategies. The culmination of this
        project was a presentation of my findings to the team, offering insights
        that could potentially shape the company's future growth trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This internship at StataPile was a pivotal step in my early career, blending
        hands-on experience with significant contributions to the company's
        operations.

      <div>
      <p>
        During my time at Blueport Commerce as a Product Manager, I had the
        opportunity to engage in a range of tasks that significantly contributed to
        the company's growth and operational efficiency. Blueport Commerce
        specializes in e-commerce platforms for large furniture retailers, a sector
        with distinct challenges due to the high value of its online sales and the
        necessity for an omnichannel approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my key responsibilities involved exploring and recommending headless
        Content Management Systems (CMS) to enhance our e-commerce solutions. This
        involved seeking CMS options that supported drag-and-drop capabilities for
        webpage building, enabling our clients, some of whom lacked technical
        expertise, to build custom pages using Angular components. Additionally, I
        focused on internal tooling to expedite the creation of tools for our team
        and clients, such as a tool for editing menu nodes, which were part of our
        custom-built client system, Hub​​. The latter project ended with a purchase
        of Retool to speed up our development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also conducted web vital tests on our client’s product display pages and
        product listing pages, analyzing scripts to identify and address performance
        issues. I was involved in the decision-making process for utilizing
        automated testing services for continuous speed monitoring​​.
      </p>
      <p>
        A notable achievement was my management in a 4-person scrum team that led to
        a significant improvement in Total Blocking Time (TBT), one of the core web
        vitals, on search pages with many results. For a product display page with
        95 results, the TBT was reduced by 74.5%, from 7.118s to 3.256s. This was
        accomplished by dividing the single search call into two separate calls, one
        of which was delayed to enhance the site's performance and user
        experience​​.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skills I gained in Jira and Confluence for sprint management, along with
        the exposure to tech company organization and prioritization, were
        invaluable, especially in my first full-time role in Product Management. I
        continued at Blueport as an Associate Product Manager the summer following
        the co-op. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also
        provided a practical application of my studies, particularly in
        understanding the organizational and prioritization aspects of being a
        Product Manager.

        In my roles at Toast, my contributions range from automating complex processes to 
        leading AI-driven initiatives, continually transforming how the Ecommerce team conducts 
        business and interacts with customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key achievement is the overhaul of the Ecommerce reporting system. Addressing the 
        challenges of manual tracking amidst a surge in deals, I lead the development of an automated 
        tracking and reporting system. Utilizing Salesforce, Google App Scripts, JavaScript, Zapier, and 
        Salesforce Connector, this new tool streamlines data management, significantly reduces errors, and 
        scales to accommodate growing transaction volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also optimized the deal-claiming process for the Online Sales Team. Replacing a cumbersome, 
        multi-spreadsheet system with a single, efficient form, I've dramatically reduced the time each team 
        member spends on administrative tasks by 30 minutes daily, cumulatively saving the team almost 38 hours 
        per week. This enhancement not only boosts productivity but also improves the accuracy of deal assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another ongoing project is the development of a customer chatbot, instrumental in increasing the 
        customer contract task completion rate by 8%. This tool, capable of handling 45 common queries and 
        integrated with an automated follow-up system, engages 11% of Ecommerce customers, ensuring timely support and 
        boosting task completion rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I regularly present my projects to cross-functional teams, fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration. 
        My presentations in Web Team Standup and Ecomm Leads Meetings are critical in aligning strategies and sharing insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        My active involvement in AI-driven projects is a highlight of my role. I have contributed to a customer-centric prototype 
        for our company-wide hackathon, receiving recognition and potential prioritization. Additionally, I am conducting an AI 
        analysis of the chatbot responses for optimization, showcasing the potential of AI in operational contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supporting the Online Sales Team, I efficiently manage order modifications in Salesforce, addressing expedited shipments and 
        other adjustments. This hands-on assistance significantly enhances customer satisfaction and order processing efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also managed the returned-to-sender process, directly interacting with customers to resolve order issues, thereby recovering 
        potential lost sales and enhancing customer experience. My time at Toast is marked by these multifaceted contributions, 
        showcasing my ability to innovate, streamline, and enhance both internal processes and customer interactions.
